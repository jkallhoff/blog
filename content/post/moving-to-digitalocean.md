Back in 2013 I made the decision to dip my big toe into the Linux world by setting up a Wordpress blog using [Web Faction][1] as a hosting provider. Having spent over a decade firmly entrenched in the Windows world as a **.Net** developer this was virgin territory for me: I'd never SSH'ed into a server, worked with MySQL, and certainly never looked too closely at PHP code.

And what a wonderful experience it was! Seriously, I can't say enough good things about [Web Faction][2] and how easy they make it to set up an account and spin up a fresh Wordpress blog. I'd say it took me 2 hours total to go from account sign up to blog up and running with minimalist styling (articles came much later).

It was during this experience that I started to get a real taste for Linux and working via the command line to explore the operating system. I was using the [$9.95 a month plan][3] which came with SSH access to a shared Centos 6 server. Because this is a shared server you're obviously not allowed "free rein" to do as you please; there are other blokes using the same server and they certainly don't want you mucking around with their processes and applications! 

As I became more proficient at Linux I also started running into roadblocks that started getting in the way of my self-education. I was attempting to set up MongoDB, compile Go from source, explore ways of keeping long processes running, and delve into the blossoming world of [ASP.NET vNext][4] and [Mono][5]. All except the last I was able to pull off using work-arounds (the Webfaction documentation is quite useful) but non of the approaches matched other documentation found online; ***I found that I was having to adapt my approach to solving these problems based on the restrictions imposed due to the shared environment***.

> Disclaimer: There's a very good chance that all of the roadblocks I encountered had very reasonable solutions and workaround. The Webfaction environment really is wonderful.

None-the-less, I made the decision over the past week to really learn Linux. I mean, **REALLY** learn it. As in set up a brand new VPS from scratch learn it. And I figured it might be time to do away with Wordpress and its constant upgrades/security holes while I was at it. **The time had come to move my blog to a static Go based blogging platform!**

The solution I chose was [**Hugo**][6], a static site generator written in Go. There was nothing about my blog that really needed dynamic components and it gave me a great excuse to get my hands dirty in Linux with the following end goals in mind:

* Move my blog from Wordpress to Hugo
* Serve the static files generated by Hugo from Nginx
	* Learn how to tune Nginx for performance
* Button up security on the server
	* Correctly configure SSH (non-root) access
	* Use firewall software to block all non-necessary ports
	* Set up some form of intrusion detection
* Setting up a monitoring tool like [New Relic][7] for server monitoring

So, over the course of the next few weeks, I'm going to kick off a series on the exact steps I took to accomplish the above goals. We'll go from Digital Ocean account sign up to a working static website served via Nginx. Stay tuned!
